# WeatherApp

WeatherApp is a simple Java CLI app that calls OpenWeatherMap API to get information about the current weather in a given location.
The location coordinates are determined by calling the Geocoding API from OpenWeatherMap.

## Set-up
To properly function, WeatherApp requires an OpenWeatherMapAPI key to be placed in the "key.txt" file, in the `...src/main/java/WeatherApp`  directory. Remember, do not publish your API keys on GitHub!
